// ISP - Interface Segregation Principle

// Interfaces should implement how the object should be, but it cannot be a fat interface
// In other words, it can't implement more than it should implement

// Interfaces should have a high level of cohesion, in other words, an interface shouldn't
// have methods that aren't correlated with the others methods

// Interfaces shouldn't have methods that could be not implemented in components
